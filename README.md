# FiltrosGeometricos aka Geometric Filters
# This is code to train a Deep Neural Network that inversely characterizes a geometric filter with one curvature.
# Inputs: Narrow band power transmitted of the filter ranging from 0Hz to 10kHz (df = 20Hz)
# Outputs: L, R, Theta_x, Theta_y of the curvature
